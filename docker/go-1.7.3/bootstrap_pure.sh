# Contains the Go tool-chain pure-Go bootstrapper, that as of Go 1.5, initiates
# not only a few pre-built Go cross compilers, but rather bootstraps all of the
# supported platforms from the origin Linux amd64 distribution.
#
# Usage: bootstrap_pure.sh
#
# Environment variables for remote bootstrapping:
#   FETCH         - Remote file fetcher and checksum verifier (injected by image)
#   ROOT_DIST     - 64 bit Linux Go binary distribution package
#   ROOT_DIST_SHA - 64 bit Linux Go distribution package checksum
#
# Environment variables for local bootstrapping:
#   GOROOT - Path to the lready installed Go runtime
set -e

# Download, verify and install the root distribution if pulled remotely
